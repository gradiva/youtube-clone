## YouTube clone

[*YouTube clone*](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/embedding-images-and-video)
following The Odin Project [HTML and CSS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3).

This project is about building a YouTube clone (only appearance) based on HTML and CSS. 

## Notes

The search box needs to be fixed, it looks unfinished. 

I learned about how to integrate a video and got more comfortable using flexbox.
